Icepack sea ice configuration
*****************************

This section describes the implementation of the Icepack sie ice column physics package in the FESOM2 model. The scope of the following paragraphs is to provide a practical guide to users interested in detailed simulations of the sea ice system with FESOM2, and not to describe the scientific features of Icepack. A detailed description of the sea ice parameterizations here implemented can be found on the website of the `CICE Consortium <https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/Icepack/wiki/Icepack-Release-Table>`_, which maintains and continuously develops this package.
